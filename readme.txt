"Well-Known URIs" for WordPress!

== Description ==

This plugin enables "Well-Known URIs" support for WordPress (RFC 5785: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785).

From the RFC:

> It is increasingly common for Web-based protocols to require the
> discovery of policy or other information about a host ("site-wide
> metadata") before making a request.  For example, the Robots
> Exclusion Protocol <http://www.robotstxt.org/> specifies a way for
> automated processes to obtain permission to access resources;
> likewise, the Platform for Privacy Preferences
> tells user-agents how to discover privacy policy beforehand.

> While there are several ways to access per-resource metadata (e.g.,
> HTTP headers, WebDAV's PROPFIND [RFC4918]), the perceived overhead
> (either in terms of client-perceived latency and/or deployment
> difficulties) associated with them often precludes their use in these
> scenarios.

> When this happens, it is common to designate a "well-known location"
> for such data, so that it can be easily located.  However, this
> approach has the drawback of risking collisions, both with other such
> designated "well-known locations" and with pre-existing resources.

> To address this, this memo defines a path prefix in HTTP(S) URIs for
> these "well-known locations", "/.well-known/".  Future specifications
> that need to define a resource for such site-wide metadata can
> register their use to avoid collisions and minimise impingement upon
> sites' URI space.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I define a well-known uri? =


Set a callback for an URI (/.well-known/robots.txt). The action is a combination of `well_known_` and the file-name, in this case the hook must look like

`add_action('well_known_robots.txt', 'robots_txt');`


Print robots.txt:


`function robots_txt($query) {
  header('Content-Type: text/plain; charset=' . get_option('blog_charset'), true);
  echo "User-agent: *";
  echo "Allow: /";

  exit;
}`

= Is there an implementation where I can write off? =

Yes, you can find an example plugin, which defines a well-known-uri,
